    <schoolProfile><![CDATA[<p><strong>School Profile</strong></p>
<p>Christian education is one of the pillars of the Seventh-day Adventist church.  This institution commenced operation in January 1958 under the leadership of Principal Mrs. Merle Bennett with a staff of ----  and  ------ students.  Its name then and still is Campbell's Castle Prep School.  Over the years the students are exposed to rules, Christian values and principles as taught by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Thus we try to develop the total person: mentally, spiritually, physically and socially making them well rounded to fit into the society as a productive citizen and more so a candidate for heaven.</p>
<p>Integration of Faith and Learning drives the curriculum and today the school is striving to be as the school of the hereafter.  Today, 59 years after the planting of the Campbell’s Castle S.D. A. Preparatory School, we continue to give thanks to God for His greatness. Many of the children who were nurtured at this small school are serving the wider community, thanks to the pioneers who built not just for time but for eternity.</p>]]></schoolProfile>

        <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Campbell’s Castle SDA Kindergarten &amp; Preparatory School exists to help prepare children to be disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. CCSDAKP seeks to honor God by giving our students a quality education designed to show that man’s knowledge is a reflection of God’s plan. CCSDAKP will honor God by instilling a desire for and love of Christ in each student so he/she will want to exemplify Him in all areas of life.</p>
<p><br />Servant leadership is exemplified by the staff and practiced by the students at CCSDAKP. Staff members serve the student body as stewards of Christ in many areas such as coaching sports, academic tutoring, and student counsel. CCSDAKP students are given the opportunity to serve each other, the staff, and the community at large. As part of servant leadership and academic excellence, CCSDAKP students are encouraged to become fluent Spanish speakers and are offered Spanish instruction Pre-K through grade 6.</p>
<p><br />Students accepted to CCSDAKP have agreed that while attending the school they will do their best to represent the finest values, morals and ideals of Christ in every circumstance in every way, every day of their lives. Students are accountable to God, their parents, and the school for their behaviour 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days per year on and off campus.</p>
<p><br />Campbell’s Castle SDA Kindergarten &amp; Preparatory School believes the Bible clearly teaches that parents are primarily responsible for their child’s upbringing, discipline, and restoration. It is our desire to be a support, not the primary solution in a child’s upbringing (Proverbs 22:6, 13:24, 23:13-14, 19:18). CCSDAKP has set Biblically-based expectations as a firm foundation to be backed by consistent encouragement and consequences in the spirit of Proverbs 22:6, 23:13-14, 19:20 and Hebrews 12:1-13. We firmly believe that God speaks to us through circumstances. Any major infraction, especially a behavioral zero tolerance infraction, is a red flashing light for parents to review their involvement in their child’s life. All disciplinary decisions are made prayerfully. It is the intention of the administration to shepherd the heart of each child. This will include active listening, teaching correct behavior, and aiding the student in reconciliation with others as well as with Jesus.</p>
<p><br />Campbell’s Caastle SDA Kindergarten &amp; Preparatory School serves the community in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by providing loving Christian care and high quality Christian education for children of parents that desire a Christ-centered education. In turn, as a school, we serve others through various outreaches locally and abroad.</p>]]></bodyText>
